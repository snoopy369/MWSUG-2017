# SESUG-2016
SAS programs for SESUG papers in 2016

This includes the two papers I wrote for SESUG-2016 (Bethesda), "Flexible Programming with Hash Tables" (CC-230) and "Writing Code With Your Data" (BB-229).

PDFs and Powerpoints for both are included here, as well as the code presented in the papers in two formats.  .ZIP files with .SAS files inside of them, and .EGP files which are compatible with EG 7.1 and newer.

Please contact the author (matise.joe@gmail.com) with any questions.
