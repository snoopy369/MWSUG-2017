# MWSUG-2017
SAS programs for MWSUG papers in 2017

This includes the paper I wrote for MWSUG-2017 (St. Louis), "Writing Code With Your Data" (Paper 116).  This paper was originally written for SESUG 2016 and is a nearly identical copy of that paper.

PDF and Powerpoint versions are included here, as well as the code presented in the paper in two formats. A .ZIP file with .SAS files inside of it, and an .EGP project which is compatible with EG 7.1 and newer.

Please contact the author (matise.joe@gmail.com) with any questions.
